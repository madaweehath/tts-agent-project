# 📰 3ulum-Alyawm Agent Service — Full Task

This service implements the full automation pipeline for the **3ulum-Alyawm Arabic News Podcast system**.  
It scrapes Arabic news articles, converts them into Saudi (Najdi) dialect using an LLM agent, classifies the content, generates speech using fine-tuned XTTS models, uploads assets to cloud storage, and outputs structured episode metadata.

- Converts Fusha Arabic into **Najdi conversational dialect** using an LLM agent

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows these stages:

1. Scraping – Fetch articles from AlRiyadh  
2. Classification – Classify article seriousness using LLM  
3. Dialect Conversion – Convert text to Najdi dialect  
4. Text-to-Speech – Generate audio using XTTS  
5. Storage – Upload outputs to Google Cloud Storage  
6. Response – Return structured episode JSON  

```

Scraper → Classifier → Dialect Agent → TTS → Cloud Storage → Episode JSON
